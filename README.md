# Arend Tutorial exercise solutions
Here are some solutions to exercises in the [Tutorial](https://arend-lang.github.io/documentation/tutorial) section of the documentation of the [Arend Theorem Prover](https://arend-lang.github.io/),
especially those that are related to HoTT.
Exercises whose similar ones are covered by [PLFA](https://plfa.github.io/) will most likely not be solved here again in Arend.
